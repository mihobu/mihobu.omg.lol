Hi! I’ve lived in the Buckeye State my entire life so far, and Columbus is my home town.

I love to travel. There are so many wonderful places that I still haven’t seen, but I’m working on it. My hobbies include [photography](https://www.flickr.com/people/mihobu/), [Amateur Radio](https://qrz.com/db/W8MHB), and crochet. I post about my varied interests here on my blog from time to time. You can [subscribe here](https://mb.monkeywalk.com/rss.xml), but only if you want to.

Computers have been part of my life since the early 1980’s, when I started entering BASIC programs on the [Commodore VIC-20](https://oldcomputers.net/vic20.html) from code listings printed in books and [magazines](https://www.vintage-computer.com/publications.php?compute). The oldest *surviving* specimen of my early work is a [horse race](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ci7r2rHbNiQ) program I co-wrote with a classmate in 12th grade. It was written in Pascal on the Apple IIe, and [compiling it was slow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AawRLA25og)!

*I have never actually used one of these but it is real and I still have it.*

I don’t go in too heavily on social media any more since *feeds* have taken over and made using Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter a miserable experience. But you can find me in the friendlier confines of [Mastodon](https://social.lol/@mihobu) and [Reddit](https://reddit.com/user/mihobu).
