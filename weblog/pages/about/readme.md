## Professional Background

Hi! I've been kicking around the IT industry for a lot of years now. My earliest experience in computing was entering BASIC programs on the [Commodore VIC-20](https://oldcomputers.net/vic20.html) from code listings printed in [magazines](https://www.vintage-computer.com/publications.php?compute). The oldest surviving specimen of my work as an aspiring Computer Scientist was a [horse race](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ci7r2rHbNiQ) I co-wrote in Pascal in 12th grade. (If you think running k-folds cross validation is slow, you should see what it was like to [compile Pascal on the Apple IIe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AawRLA25og) in 1989!)

I have a bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering from [Ohio State](https://cse.ohio-state.edu/) (where I [teach](/2021/05/my-prior-teaching-assignments) from time to time) and a master's degree in Data Science from [Southern Methodist University](https://datascience.smu.edu/).

I've written code in many languages for online systems, web development projects, system administration, and data mining tasks. Although I've coded in some ancient languages - FORTRAN and JCL come to mind, but not COBOL or LISP - I never actually dealt with [punch cards](https://mihobu.github.io/mihobu.omg.lol/weblog/pages/about/card.jpg). More recently, I've worked in the world of large systems integration with a specialization in IT infrastructure. I currently work as a cloud data architect at [Huntington National Bank](https://huntington.com/), where I am focused on scalable data processing and machine learning in the cloud (mostly AWS).

## Other Interests

I have more hobbies than I can keep up with, but I manage to engage in all of them at least some of the time. My favorites are [Amateur Radio](https://qrz.com/db/W8MHB), [photography](https://www.flickr.com/photos/mihobu), travel, certain outdoor pursuits (hiking, biking, kayaking), and crochet. I also read a fair bit—mostly non-fiction but also a novel here and there. I’m fairly active on social media. You’ll find me mostly on [Mastodon](https://social.lol/@mihobu), [Reddit](https://reddit.com/user/mihobu), and a few Discord servers.
