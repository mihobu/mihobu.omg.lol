Hi! I am Michael and I live in Columbus, Ohio. I’ve been tinkering with computers since the early 1980's. My earliest experience was entering BASIC programs on the [Commodore VIC-20](https://oldcomputers.net/vic20.html) from code listings printed in books and [magazines](https://www.vintage-computer.com/publications.php?compute). The oldest *surviving* specimen of that early work is a [horse race](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ci7r2rHbNiQ) program I co-wrote in Pascal in 12th grade. If you think running k-folds cross validation is slow, you should see what it was like to [compile Pascal on the Apple IIe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AawRLA25og) in 1989! FWIW, I’ve never actually worked with [punch cards](https://mihobu.github.io/mihobu.omg.lol/weblog/pages/about/card.jpg). These days I work as a cloud data architect and I tinker with my [profile](https://mihobu.monkeywalk.com), [weblog](https://mb.monkeywalk.com), and [now page](https://mihobu.monkeywalk.com/now). For more about my professional background, I invite you to visit my [LinkedIn profile](https://linkedin.com/in/mihobu).

## My Interests

My favorite things are traveling and [photography](https://www.flickr.com/people/mihobu/), which generally go hand in hand. As always, I’m behind on posting my most recent travel photos. I’ve had my [Amateur Radio](https://qrz.com/db/W8MHB) license since I was 12 years old. After quite a few years of inactivity, I picked up the hobby again last year and it’s been just as much fun as I remember.

In the warmer months, you can find me out on my bicycle quite a lot, although Columbus isn’t the most bike-friendly place in the world. I also like to hike and kayake occasionally, and my wife tells me that stand-up paddling is in my future too.

I gave up Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter, but you can find me on the friendlier alternatives [Mastodon](https://social.lol/@mihobu) and [Reddit](https://reddit.com/user/mihobu). I’m engaged on a few Discord servers too.
