# ChatGPT Poetry Corner

I asked [CahtGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/) to write a poem about automation using AWS Lambda and YAML, and here's what it produced:

> In the world of technology, automation reigns,
> With AWS Lambda, it's now routine to gain,
> The power to process, without delay,
> With YAML, a configuration, in a language array.
> 
> YAML is simple, yet flexible and neat,
> It's easy to write, and can't be beat,
> For describing data, in a structured way,
> It makes AWS Lambda, a joy to play.
> 
> With AWS Lambda and YAML combined,
> We can automate, what was once confined,
> To manual tasks, time-consuming and slow,
> Now with just a few lines, we make it go.
> 
> The cloud is the home, where it all resides,
> With scalability and reliability, it's where AWS resides,
> And Lambda Functions, are the heart of this beat,
> With YAML, they function, with such fluidity and heat.
> 
> So here's to automation, with AWS and YAML,
> They make our lives easier, and work less of a hassle,
> With their power and ease, we can focus on what's true,
> Leaving the tedious tasks, to the machines we ensue.
