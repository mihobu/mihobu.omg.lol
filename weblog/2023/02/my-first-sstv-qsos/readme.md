# My First SSTV QSOs

This week I dipped my toe in the Slow Scan Television (SSTV) waters. I’ve long been fascinated
by the idea of sending pictures over the radio, although in the 2020’s it doesn’t seem so exotic!
Still I made my first QSO this week and have made a few more while trying to learn the SSTV culture and
etiquette on the fly. Below are a few of this week’s images.

All contacts were on 14.230 MHz.

This is a fun mode and I think I’ll take it out for a spin every now and then. It’s a bit time consuming,
at least for me as I figure out how to use the [MMSSTV](https://hamsoft.ca/pages/mmsstv.php) software and scramble to find interesting images to send.
