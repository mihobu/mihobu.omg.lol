# My 2023 Photography Challenge

![img](https://cdn.some.pics/mihobu/641a058c2117e.jpg)

I’ve decided to start a [52 weeks of photography 2023](https://www.clondon.me/blog/52-2023) challenge, which is being led by Prague-based photographer Chelsea London. The goal is to take at least one new photograph per week throughout the year. I’m trying to make photography more of a habit, so this challenge seems like a nice fit.

I’ll post my photos and reflections to [a Flickr album](https://www.flickr.com/photos/mihobu/albums/72177720305599640) throughout the year. I'll update this post with the prompts (in *italicized* text) and links so it can serve as the master index for my participation.

## February: The Everyday

*Now that goals have been sorted out, it’s time to work. All the prompts for the month of February can be done from the comfort of your own home. This will allow you to find your rhythm and explore the space in an environment you’re relaxed in.*

- One object. *For this prompt, we’ll be exploring a single object in various ways. Try out different angles, various lighting, maybe even placement in a larger scene. Your end goal is discover how you can approach the same subject from many different perspectives. Feel free to submit one photo, or a curated diptych or triptych.*

- What’s in your ~~wallet~~ bag? *Here we're going to look at the things we carry with us on a daily basis. Use this as an opportunity to try out staging your items. Some ideas may be placing the items in a traditional still life setting, a top-down shot, cascading from your bag, etc.*

- Your home. *“Home” has different meanings to each of us. Is it the space in which you live? Is it with those with whom you feel most comfortable? Is it being engaged in something you love and are passionate about? Think about what “home” means to you, and tell us through your photography.*

- A Day in the Life. *This one needs a little explanation, and is one of my all-time favorite exercises. It’s a bit involved, so stay with me. Choose one day this month where you will document the entire day - from the moment you wake up, to the moment you go to sleep. Aim to take at least one photo every hour. At the end, cull it down to no more than 10 photos which tell the story of your day. Then, choose just one hero photo which sums it up in its entirety.*

## January: Setting Goals

*Each year we start out by considering why we’re participating in this project. Whether personal or professional, identifying goals makes the following year more meaningful and intentional. For this month, the prompts are all focused on helping you to identify how to make the most out of the project.*

  - [Past experiences with photography](https://www.flickr.com/photos/mihobu/52603438696/in/album-72177720304836703/). *Every participant comes to this challenge at a different stage in their photographic journey. Show us where you are - in whatever manner you prefer.* (Jan. 2)
  - [Artistic fears](https://www.flickr.com/photos/mihobu/52615716026/in/album-72177720304836703/). *A huge hurdle to get over is identifying what scares you about your art. Take this as an opportunity to face one of those fears.* (Jan. 8)
  - [Another hobby or passion](https://www.flickr.com/photos/mihobu/52654406614/in/album-72177720304836703/). *One of the best ways to get good at photography is to join it with something else you’re passionate about. Use your other hobbies as inspiration for this photo.* (Jan. 19)
  - [A main photographic goal for the year](https://www.flickr.com/photos/mihobu/52654429239/in/album-72177720304836703/). *What do you hope to get out of this challenge? Make a photo that illustrates what you hope to achieve photographically in 2023.* (Jan. 25)
