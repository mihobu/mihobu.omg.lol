# Some Photography Lessons Learned

I recently returned from a trip to sunny and warm Puerto Vallarta, Mexico. Most of the photographs I take come from trips like this, rather than when I‚Äôm home. I like to have a camera with me when walking around, although I‚Äôm not really into street photography per se. Here‚Äôs what I learned. (These aren‚Äôt meant to be general recommendations, but rather observations about myself, my habits, and my preferences. Your mileage will almost certainly vary.)

## Portability is Key

My goal going into this trip was to be as portable as possible so that I‚Äôd be able to have a camera with me all the time. I wanted to avoid the scenario in which I missed a shot because I didn‚Äôt feel like lugging the camera along.

## Lugging or Carrying?

A few years ago I picked up a really nice [BlackRapid shoulder harness](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1278394-REG/blackrapid_361005_sport_breathe_single_strap.html). At the time my primary camera was a Nikon D7200, which is neither slim not lightweight, and the should strap was a huge help. I‚Äôve since switched up to a [Fujifilm X-T4](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1548392-REG/fujifilm_16652867_x_t4_mirrorless_digital_camera.html) (which I üíñ) and the shoulder strap still works great, especially for hiking, biking, or day-long adventures like amusement park visits. However, it‚Äôs a bit obtrusive and makes me feel like it attracts a lot of attention in casual settings like lunch with friends or strolling through the market.

Before this trip I bought a [BlackRapid wrist strap](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1278403-REG/blackrapid_362009_wrist_breathe_single_strap.html) to try out. I was very pleased. It made grabbing the camera on the way out the door easy, and was the reason I had my camera with me nearly 100% of the time we were away from the apartment. Super happy with that purchase!

On longer excursions, I found that the weight of carrying my X-T4 with only a wrist strap did eventually tire my hand and wrist so there's definitely a point of diminishing returns after which the shoulder strap would have been better. For me, that was somewhere in range of two to three hours of continuous walking/standing. On one such outing, in which we covered 6.6 miles on foot in around three hours, I was wishing I had the shoulder strap!

## Lenses

I struggle with this one a lot. Zooms are handy, especially for travel, but I haven‚Äôt found one I‚Äôm ready to buy yet. (Maybe I need to grab this [XC 15-45mm](https://www.adorama.com/ifj1545s.html).) Anyway, for now all I have are three primes. I‚Äôve had these for about a year, and here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve learned about each one:

- [XF 35mm f/2 R W](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1192471-REG/fujifilm_16481880_xf_35mm_f_2_r.html): I thought this normal-length prime‚Äînot to big, nice maximum aperture‚Äîwould be my favorite when I bought it with the X-T4 body back in 2021. It has been **by far** my least favorite lens. I pulled it out one day during my recent trip and was reminded of what I already knew: it‚Äôs just way too long for most ‚Äùwalking around‚Äú scenarios.
- [XF 16mm f/2.8 R WR](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1459275-REG/fujifilm_xf_16mm_f_2_8_r.html): I enjoy shooting with this lens a lot. It‚Äôs wide (but not too wide) angle makes for a lot of interesting images. But who wants a whole day‚Äôs worth of 16mm? (Not me.) On this trip, it stayed in my bag and never came out.
- [XF 27mm f/2.8 R WR](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1618892-REG/fujifilm_16670168_xf_27mm_f_2_8_r.html): It is very compact, has excellent image quality, is fast, and the focal length is good for most situations. I love this lens. It‚Äôs *almost* enough for me to forget about zoom lenses.

## Tripod Or No Tripod?

I have a [SmallRig 3033 Aluminum Tabletop Mini Tripod with Ball Head](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1611107-REG/smallrig_3033_aluminum_tabletop_mini_tripod.html) that totally kicks ass. It is small, lightweight, inexpensive, and has a high quality ball head. It works with the ARCA-type quick-release plate on my X-T4 as well as the [MeFOTO SideKick360 Plus Smartphone Tripod Adapter](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1123501-REG/mefoto_mph200k_sidekick_360_plus_smart.html) to make a full-featured travel kit.

That I never use.

I‚Äôve lugged that thing to Hawai‚Äôi, France, and Mexico and it has stayed in my suitcase on all three trips. I tend to take photos mostly in daylight, and my X-T4 performs really well in low light with the XF 27mm lens, rendering the tripod nearly useless.

## Aquae Incognita

I don‚Äôt get in the water very much so I‚Äôve never had a reason to shoot underwater. But we are planning a trip to the Galapagos Islands next year and we wanted to start exploring photographic options for wet environments. I used the Mexico trip as an excuse to buy a red [Olympus Tough TG-6](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1477205-REG/olympus_v104210ru000_tough_tg_6_digital_camera.html) for ‚Äútesting‚Äù purposes.

It did not disappoint.

This camera may not have it all, but it‚Äôs got a lot. It is small and lightweight, making it easy to keep close by. It‚Äôs also waterproof‚Äîno expensive housing needed! (I also bought a [floating wrist strap](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/882584-REG/Olympus_202544_Adjustable_Float_Strap_for.html) which is a lot less obtrusive that it looks.) I took this little red wonder along on a whale watching trip on the Bah√≠a de Banderas. The vast majority of the [frames I shot that day](https://www.flickr.com/photos/mihobu/albums/72177720305589284/) are of the empty sea, hoping to catch a glimpse of one of the big beasts. A big reason for this is that the frame rate is so freaking fast! The image quality is pretty darn good too, considering it‚Äôs got only a 12MP sensor. Color and sharpness aren‚Äôt bad considering the alternative might well be no pictures at all.

## Conclusions

This was a fun trip, and I learned a lot from it. I think I might order that zoom lens now. ü§î With that and the [2023 challenge](/2023/01/my-2023-photography-challenge) it‚Äôs shaping up to be a fun year for photography.
